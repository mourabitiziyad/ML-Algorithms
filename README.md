# Machine Learning Algorithms

Typical ML Algorithms built from scratch and inspired from the Web.

# Available Algorithms

- Linear Regression (Heavily inspired from Sentdex Youtube Tutorials)
  - Based purely on randomly generated data
  - Includes a plot for easy data visualisation
  - Support for selection of positive / negative correlation (or neither)

# Upcoming Algorithms

- K-Nearest Neighbour(s)
- K-Means
- ...

# Future Additions

- Applications of built ML Algorithms in real dataset with performance comparisons to Scikit-Learn Library
- Clearer Code Comments
- Easily Readable Code

# Technologies Used (Limited to Available Algorithms):

- Python 3.8
- pip 20.1.1
- matplotlib 3.3.0
- numpy 1.19.1
- scikit-learn 0.23.1 *
- Pandas 1.0.5 *
